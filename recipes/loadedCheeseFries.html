        <ol>
            <li>Bake the fries according to package directions.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, prepare the cheese sauce. In a sauce pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute, whisking continuously, until light golden brown. Slowly whisk in the milk and lower the heat. Bring the milk to a gentle simmer and then add the cheese, pickled jalapeño juice, and cayenne pepper. Keep stirring the sauce until the cheese is completely melted and smooth. About 5 minutes. Taste and season with salt.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl or serving platter, build the loaded fries. Layer fries, cheese sauce, bacon and green onions. Repeat. Make sure to get the cheese sauce and toppings on every layer. At the end, garnish the fries with pickled jalapeños and sour cream or crema.</li>
