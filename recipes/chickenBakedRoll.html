            <li>2 cup cooked chicken</li>
            <li>1 cup bacon crisps</li>

            <li>Divide the pizza dough into 6 even pieces.</li>
            <li>Roll out each piece into a rectangular shape. Spread on the ranch dressing, being sure to leave about an inch on all sides.</li>
            <li>Top off with chicken and bacon.</li>
            <li>Follow by a handful of Mozzarella cheese. Roll it up and place it to rest on an oiled baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Apply a tiny bit of ranch on the outside. Bake it at 415Â°F for about 17 minutes, remove from the oven and sprinkle on the parmesan cheese. Bake for another 3-5 minutes or until they become golden brown.</li>
            <li>Serve hot while the cheese is melted.</li>
